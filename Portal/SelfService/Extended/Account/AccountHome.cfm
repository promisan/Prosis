			A #SESSION.welcome# logon account allows you to access modules that are or will be opened for you to access. 
			In order for you to request a logon account you need to submit you first and lastname along with a valid eMail address.
			<br><br>
			Your request will be validated against the submitted e-Mail address which needs to be unique. 
			You might already have an assigned account and we will inform you immediately once we have matched your request. 
			Once your request is successfully submitted, you will be informed by designated officials about your account and granted access.
