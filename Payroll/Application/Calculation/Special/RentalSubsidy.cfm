as part oft he process the entitlement month for a certain schedule

1.	identify RS entitlements that are valid for the entitlement month/schedule being calculated : pre - done
2.	obtain the salary amount from the defined base : real entitlement (days - slwop) or base entitlement (working days) or ????? 

==   obtain the number of qualifying dependents for that month : done
    (which is obtain already earlier in the calculation process which needs to be adjusted)

3. obtain the correct threshold percentage based on dependents y/n
		24 depedents = 0 or 23 dependetns > 0

4. obtain the NET RENT from entitlement (which is recorded as rent - utilities in the entitlement ENTRYFORM)	
	    obtain the maximum rent allowed from the scale rates based on the dependent match : pre done 
		  == (similar is done already, correct if dependent count > 2 to 2 to match the record. ===

take the lowest of NET rent versus MAXIMUM rent

apply percentage (80%) which will be driven by a custom table : year and NC/FM : 
				YEARS : to be derrived from (see question) 
				NC/FM : to be derrived from entitlement ENTRYFORM : EntitlementGroup
	
resulting amount if not higher than 40% of the NET RENT = RS, otherwise 40% of NET rent = RS.

the amount is prorated for the days if  the entitlement ends during the month (initial appointment or separation)
