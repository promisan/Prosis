Validation Rule :  R19
Name			:  Checking whether The Travel Involved Heiti Travel and the Traveller Indicated Accomadation Provided
Creation Date	:  21-Apr-2010
Created         :  JG3
This validation is created  of the Circular from OHRM on Haiti Condition and to provide them with 100 %  DSA. Since this is a 
temporary arrangement we are just creating a validation which will trigger such condition and set it as incomplete and then 
accounts would manually change the amount depending on the situation and approve it.
