<!--- 
This is also another query which will work , but the other one is better query 
since it will display the docid and TVCV created too with the status ,even if there
are more than one.

SELECT     CL.ClaimId, CL.ClaimRequestId
		FROM         Claim AS CL INNER JOIN
              stPerson AS PRSN ON CL.PersonNo = PRSN.PersonNo INNER JOIN
              ClaimRequest AS TVRQ ON CL.ClaimRequestId = TVRQ.ClaimRequestId
		WHERE     (TVRQ.DocumentNo IN
                 	(SELECT     DocIdRequest
                       FROM          IMP_CLAIM AS IMP
                       WHERE      (db_mdst_source = 'UNHQ') AND (f_dorf_id_code = 'TVCV') AND (DocIdRequest = TVRQ.DocumentNo) AND 
                       (f_prsn_index_num = PRSN.IndexNo)
				 	)
				 ) AND (CL.ClaimId = '#URL.ClaimId#')

<!---
JG Joining against Claim , Claimrequest, TVCV documents and the person table to find out
whether there is TVCV that was created either earlier or outside of the portal
if so prevent it to go through the portal
