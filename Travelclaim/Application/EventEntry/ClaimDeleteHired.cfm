<!--- Query written so that the ClaimEventIndicatorcostline 
       Gets deleted for the case where for  a TVRQ  
	   initially which was changed to Hired /Taxi and a LTR line
	   was added under other expenses and finally , The Hired was changed
	   back to Air , and the other screeen no longer shows the LTR line 
	   but shows up in the summary screen since the amounts are there .
	   This procedure deletes the cost line tables and the supporting
	   tables where the enteries are there.
