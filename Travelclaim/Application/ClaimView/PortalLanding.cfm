<table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td>
This template is the main container for the portal home screen. The screen lists claims per status of submission.

1. Check if the PersonNo passed from the logon screen is a valid personNo, this prevent issues in case the browser would not pass the URL properly. This problem has been noticed several times and the included validation.

2. Check if there are any claims with status = 8 in the database for this users. Status 8 is a temporary status in case a user decides not to continue with the claim. Instead of purging the draft claim immediately the system first sets is action status to 8 before the claim is purged when this screen is reload as part of the go back routine the user opted for. It is a transition status.

3. Check if there are claims with status 6 in the database for this user which do not exist in IMIS (IMP_Claim). Since claims with status 6 are claims not raised with the TCP its sole purpose is to show what is in IMIS. If somehow the claim does not exisit in IMIS, there is no reason to show this claim in TCP either.

4. Check if TCP claims which have been uploaded into IMIS do indeed still exist in IMIS. In case the TCP claim does not exist in IMIS anymore its status is set to 9 (cancelled) and made invisble for the user. In principle this should not happen. In the case the claims would not be available in IMIS due to a temporary outage of IMIS causing the IMP_Claim table to be incomplete or empty this action would be reversed by the batch the next time the batch would run.

5. Check if the claim status is set to at least 3 for claims that have been recorded as export.

Note to the file : All verifications are worst case verifications to prevent claims are show to the user incorrectly. Most of these verifications were driven by a testing/development scenario in which data was manipulated, hence strange things would occur.
