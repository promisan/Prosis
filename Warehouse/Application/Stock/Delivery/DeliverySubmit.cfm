<!--- save the delivery request 

Allow to select the type of workorder : delivery and class for the modality <br>

- Transfer to shipper 
- Delivery internal
- Orgunit that performs : orgunitimplementer
- OrgUnit that triggers => warehouse orgunit

first we check if the customer exists in workorder and will add the record 
the we record workorder and workorder line 
and create an action

then we show the workflow object
