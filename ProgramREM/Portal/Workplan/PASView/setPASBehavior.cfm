<!--- This template record by default the behaviors that will be a basis for rating in the full evaluation.

Assuming that ePas Contracts have been already created 
operational=true
and 
actionstatus=0 (only at the initiation stage)
valid ones;
What I understand is that we will run this on July 1st.
So all the item (questions) will be populated.

This is to say that if a person moves after July 1st, then the person will be evaluated based on the functionNo
he/she had at that date.
