<!--- The purpose of this tool is to define the funding of the charges based on the settings
if the posting mode is defined as "Funding". The system tries to assign the
funding as good as possible based on the effective date for the funding in a top down fashion --->

<!--- 2012-01-27 JDiaz. Provision to avoid overlaping effective periods in fundings at the billing level --->

<cfquery name = "OverlapingFunding"

<!--- end provision for overlaping funding effective periods --->


<!--- A. first we define the global level for the workorder in which we look at the funding on workorder level : UNIT is ANY only --->
<cfquery name = "Global"
  datasource  = "NovaWorkOrder"
  username    = "#SESSION.login#"
  password    = "#SESSION.dbpw#"
  timeout="#scripttimeout#">	
			UPDATE    skWorkOrderCharges
			SET       FundingId = F.FundingId
			FROM      WorkOrderFunding AS F INNER JOIN
			          skWorkOrderCharges AS C ON F.WorkOrderId = C.WorkOrderId
			WHERE     F.ServiceItemUnit IS NULL  <!--- unit global --->		  
			AND       F.WorkOrderLine   IS NULL  <!--- billing line --->	
			AND       F.BillingDetailId IS NULL  <!--- detail unit --->	 
			<!--- define only matching funding period --->    			
			AND       C.ServiceItem   = '#ProcessService#'
			<!--- ignore cancelled records --->
			AND       F.Operational   = 1			
			AND       C.SelectionDate >= F.DateEffective
			AND       (
			          C.SelectionDate <= F.DateExpiration or F.DateExpiration is NULL
					  )  
</cfquery>		

<!--- B. additional granularly define it on the workorder / UNIT level : this is the definition in the main screen to select a unit in addition --->

<cfquery name  = "GlobalUnit"
  datasource  = "NovaWorkOrder"
  username    = "#SESSION.login#"
  password    = "#SESSION.dbpw#"
  timeout     = "#scripttimeout#">	
	UPDATE    skWorkOrderCharges
	SET       FundingId = F.FundingId

	          skWorkOrderCharges AS C ON F.WorkOrderId = C.WorkOrderId
			  AND F.ServiceItemUnit = C.ServiceItemUnit
	WHERE     F.WorkOrderLine IS NULL    <!--- billing line --->	
	AND       F.BillingDetailId IS NULL <!--- detail unit --->
	<!--- define only matching funding period --->

<!--- C. then we define an overrule by the billing level for a workorder line 
BUT ONLY IF of this is NOT an SLA enabled workorder  --->

		<!--- define only matching funding period --->
		
		<!--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --->
		<!--- 26/01/2012  HANNO we need to do a better job to take ONLY the most recent funding record here as these may have several results --->
