How to forecast

- Initial work to be performed

i.   People currently performing the Functional title / Grade in the mission are these considered rostered : Yes ?
ii.  People that performed the job in the past : No ?
iii.


- A. Define starting situation per bucket current levels )FCRB + Rostered

- B. Dededuct people IN the roster have been selected less than N days ago, which

--- = opening balance

- C. Define number of vacancies currently being processed for that grade/title

---- = corrected opening balance

- D0 Define ratio at opening balance

			Demand (= summed per Function/PostGrade per mission) 

			vs 
			
			Roster 	(= Rostered but not performing [A] + People currently performing [B]) 
			
			= CoverRatio

	
- D1 Apply antipated Demand per mission in the coming 12 months based on Business Rule assumptions per mission on increase/decrease 
needs per bucket = % increase / decrease

- D2 Anticipate Roster outflow because of Retirement (age) in 12 months

- D3 Apply Roster inflow from missions due to decreased demand (redeployment) = #number (relates ~ D1, but not all decrease will
result in increased numbers for [A])

- D4. Mark down the rostered candidates [A] for normal wear and tear of the rostered by decreasing NN% per month as candidate move out, are not interested
in UN anymore or not interested in the job anymore.

- D9 : calculate the expected CoverRatio per bucket by applying D1..D4 correction and compare this with the target of 125% (I saw something like that)

>> i don't agree with the ratio 3 times * vacant post ; that one does not make sense inthe above <<

- then Take action on the result.
